# Fundamental data types

##### C++ comes with built-in support for many different data types. These are called fundamental data types, but are often informally called basic types, primitive types, or built-in types.

##### Here is a list of the fundamental data types, some of which you have already seen:

|             *Types*                                                           | *Category*               | *Meaning*                                        | *Example* |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------|:---------:|
| *float*, *double*, *long double*                                              | __Floating Point__       | a number with a fractional part                  | 3.14159   |
| *bool*                                                                        | __Integral (Boolean)__   |	true or false                                   |	true      |
| *char*, *wchar_t*, *char8_t* (C++20), *char16_t* (C++11), *char32_t* (C++11)  | __Integral (Character)__ | a single character of text                       | ‘c’       |
| *short*, *int*, *long*, *long long* (C++11)                                   | __Integral (Integer)__   | positive and negative whole number, including 0  | 64        |
| *std::nullptr_t* (C++11)                                                      | __Null Pointer__         | a null pointer                                   | nullptr   |
| *void*                                                                        | __void__                 | no type                                          | n/a       |
